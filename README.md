# 🧠 DSA-in-Java

A comprehensive repository for learning and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. This project is designed for those preparing for technical interviews and coding assessments, while also building strong foundational skills in Java.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build strong understanding of DSA concepts from scratch
- Practice writing clean, testable Java code
- Master problem-solving patterns commonly asked in interviews
- Create modular, reusable code grouped by topic

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or Java 8+ with minor adjustments)
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Java IDE
- Basic familiarity with object-oriented programming

---


Each folder corresponds to a DSA topic and contains:
- Core implementations (e.g., custom `LinkedList`, `Stack`)
- Common operations (e.g., reverse, insert, delete)
- Problem-solving patterns and interview questions

## 🧪 Running the Project

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Set up your SDK (Java 17+ recommended)
3. Navigate to `main/Main.java`
4. Run the file to test functionality

---

## 📘 Learning Style

- All data structures are implemented from scratch first
- Then Java’s built-in classes (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`) are compared
- Code is broken into small, testable, well-named functions
- Comments explain every method, field, and logic used

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Keep a checklist or Kanban board (Trello, GitHub Projects) to track:
- ✅ Implementations complete
- 🧪 Tests added
- 📚 Problems practiced
